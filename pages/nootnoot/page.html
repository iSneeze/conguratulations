            <p>I don’t think we can fit all your candles on a single cake this year so you’re gonna have to eat… a few
                cakes, I lost count. I hope you have a great time on your very special day and that you enjoy all your
                shrimps cute birthday messages! </p>

            <p>P.S. The monogatari series music co-labs you dropped recently are SO FRICKIN’ GOOD! Always makin’ me
                proud of
                ya sharky! <span class="emoji gurapat"></p>

            <p>Oh yeah and my art work… I never claimed to be an artist, but it’s the best I could do while falling
                asleep
                during a three hour university lecture! <span class="emoji gurahaha"></p>
