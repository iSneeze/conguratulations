            <p>Hello, Miss Sharkie!
                Fireholder, here.</p>
        </section>

        <p>I'm not very good at these sorts of things, so I'll try to be brief.
            Simply put, there really aren't words to express just how much you've meant
            these past couple years.</p>
        <p>I found you at the lowest, most stressful part of my 42 years, and your
            brightness shone light the whole way through that darkness.
            You awoke feelings in me that I thought were long dead or I had never had
            in the first place.</p>
        <p>You have an amazing personality, and despite my life, I'm nothing but glad
            I was given the opportunity to know and experience everything you've shared
            with us.</p>
        <p>I can't make promises, but I hope I get to stick around to see you grow and
            become even brighter.</p>
        <p>You are one of the best things to ever happen to humanity, and I smile
            knowing I got to be here for at least a part of it.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Keep shining brightly, Little One, and thank you forever!</p>
