            <p>Oh sharkie, these are the sharks we adopted last year for your birthday and I am one of the project team
                member from #shrimps4sharks ( a smaller community aimed at helping sharks around the world through
                charity
                donations )</p>

            <p>Hereâ€™s the update we got recently:</p>

                    Birthday Gura!!! We wanted to provide you with updates on the sharks we named in yours&#39;s and
                    Bloop&#39;s honor last year! You&#39;re pretty elusive to not be caught again! I believe you ate
                    Bloop and swam away! I joke. <br><br>Congrats on 4M as well! <a
